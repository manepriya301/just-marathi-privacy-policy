                        keep most data on your device. If we share data with

                    If your child uses this app: we do not knowingly collect
                    personal information from children under 13 (or the minimum
                    age in your jurisdiction) without verifiable parental
                    consent. The app primarily stores data locally on-device.
                    Where remote services are used (for backups, analytics, or
                    crash reporting), data is minimized and, where possible,
                    pseudonymized. Contact the email below to request deletion
                    of a child's data or to raise concerns.

                <h3 id="what-we-collect">1. What we collect</h3>
                <p>We collect three main types of information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Information you give us:</strong> If the app
                        offers registration, profile fields, or you contact
                        support, you may provide name, email, or messages. This
                        is stored only to provide the requested feature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Device and usage data:</strong> Device model, OS
                        version, unique (platform) identifiers, session times,
                        feature usage, and crash logs. This helps us diagnose
                        and fix problems and improve the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Permissions-based data:</strong> If you allow
                        camera, storage, or other permissions, the app can
                        access the corresponding data. We request permissions
                        only when necessary for a feature.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="how-we-use">2. How we use information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To provide and improve app features and performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>To analyze crashes and fix bugs.</li>
                    <li>To respond to support requests and feedback.</li>
                    <li>
                        To comply with legal obligations or to protect users'
                        safety and the app's rights.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="storage">3. Where data is stored</h3>
                <p>
                    Most user content and settings are stored locally on your
                    device. If we use remote services (for example cloud
                    backups, analytics, or crash reporting), relevant data may
                    be transmitted to those providers. We minimize what is sent
                    and avoid sending identifiable personal details unless you
                    explicitly provide them.
                </p>

                <h3 id="sharing">4. Sharing and third parties</h3>
                <p>
                    We do not sell personal information. We may share data with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Service providers (analytics, hosting, crash-reporting)
                        who are contractually restricted from using the data for
                        other purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Law enforcement or government bodies if required by law.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="cookies">5. Cookies and local storage</h3>
                <p>
                    As a native mobile app, the product mainly uses platform
                    storage rather than browser cookies. If any web views are
                    used, web-based storage/cookies may apply within those web
                    views.
                </p>

                <h3 id="security-section">6. Security</h3>
                <p>
                    We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to
                    protect data. However, no system is 100% secure — please
                    consider this before sharing highly sensitive information.
                </p>

                <h3 id="retention">7. Retention</h3>
                <p>
                    We keep data only as long as necessary to provide the app
                    and comply with legal obligations. You can request deletion at https://forms.gle/xaYNNBwHoG9XPJN28;
                    we will remove data from active systems unless law requires
                    retention.
                </p>

                <h3 id="rights">8. Your rights</h3>
                <p>
                    Depending on your location, rights may include accessing,
                    correcting, deleting, or exporting personal information.
                    Residents of regions with specific privacy laws (for
                    example, GDPR in the EEA, or CCPA/CPRA in California) have
                    additional rights described in those laws. To exercise
                    rights, contact the developer using the details below.
                </p>


                <h3 id="international">10. International transfers</h3>
                <p>
                    Data may be processed or stored in countries different from
                    your residence. By using the app, you consent to transfer of
                    data to such locations. Where required by law, we implement
                    appropriate safeguards.
                </p>

                <h3 id="changes-policy">11. Changes to this policy</h3>
                <p>
                    We may update this policy. If changes are material, we will
                    provide notice in the app or by other means and update the
                    effective date at the top.
